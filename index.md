## How can I help? 

I’m writing a book called Unpractical Decisions, focused on the decisions leaders struggle with most—the ones where stakes are high, information is ambiguous, and choices feel tangled. My aim is to help founders, executives, and boards cut through that fog using a blend of clear thinking, behavioral science, and practical experience.

After years leading engineers and data scientists to create value from complex information, I’ve developed a perspective that bridges theory and practice. Whether you’re shaping strategy, hiring mission-critical roles, or deciding when to pivot or persevere, my approach gives you a sharper, faster way to decide.


## Fields of interest

I’m especially interested in complex decision challenges in areas such as:

* Applying AI to create meaningful global impact
* Designing policies to address the climate crisis
* Improving group decision-making within organizations
* Economic and strategic decisions (auction theory, game theory)
* Decision-making at the board and governance level
* Large-scale moral and ethical trade-offs
* High-stakes decisions in early-stage startups
