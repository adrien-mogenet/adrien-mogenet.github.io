## How can I help? 

I'm researching and currently writing a book about what I call "Unpractical Decisions," to explain why some decisions are difficult, and propose solutions everyone can implement to decide quicker and with greater confidence. My approach can be applied to high-stakes decisions (building strategies, hiring for critical roles, tactical purchases, cutting losses...) as well as everyday decisions. I'm leveraging my experience leading teams of engineers and data scientists, with whom I spent years generating value from data, to complement the different fields of decision theory (Game Theory, Rational Thinking, Nudge Theory...).


## Fields of interest

I'm particularly interested to hear about challenges in these fields:

* Setting policies to fight the climate crisis
* Decisions in sports (strategies, hiring decisions)
* Group decisions in organizations
* Economic decisions (auction theory, game theory)
* Boards decisions in large organizations
* Moral dilemmas, applied at a large scale
* Decisions in early-stage startups
